# Ways to do things

A silly little repo.

--------------
(fork: expanded version of https://github.com/peterbourgon/ways-to-do-things)

@peterbourgon presented this at the Go Berlin Meetup on 2017/03/20. It used commits do present different appoaches to model Actors in Go.

To keep it bit more digestable this repo has all the original commits in separate folders.
